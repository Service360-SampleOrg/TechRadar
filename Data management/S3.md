While S3 is an amazing tech for some general data storage needs, I'm not
sure that using it as the main data storage was/is worth it. Still needs
proper assessment from price/performance perspective.

Let's see if we can use S3 as the main data storage. It looks rather 
cheap and scalable for Service360 usecase.
